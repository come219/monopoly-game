Monopoly Junior is a simplified version of the classic Monopoly game, designed for younger children. Some of the main differences between Monopoly Junior and the original game include:

Simplified rules: Monopoly Junior has simplified rules and gameplay mechanics compared to the original game. For example, players only collect $2 for passing Go, and there are fewer types of spaces on the board.

Smaller board: Monopoly Junior has a smaller board with fewer spaces than the original game. The board is also designed to be more colorful and kid-friendly.

Lower prices: The prices of properties and other game elements in Monopoly Junior are much lower than in the original game. This allows younger children to more easily understand the concept of buying and selling properties.

No auctions: In Monopoly Junior, properties are bought directly from the bank and there are no auctions. This simplifies the gameplay and makes it easier for younger children to understand.

Single denomination money: Monopoly Junior uses only $1 bills, which helps children learn basic math skills and makes it easier for them to manage their money during the game.
